# Laizy Example Run

This is a concrete brief-to-run example showing the durable artifacts Laizy expects workers to exchange.

It follows the recommended supervised operator path: `start-run` once, then `supervisor-tick` for continuation decisions. The lower-level `init-run` command remains available for compatibility and debugging, but it is not the primary story in this example.

## Example brief

> Add verification-loop scaffolding to Laizy so milestone completion is gated on explicit verification results.

## 1. Bootstrap the run

```bash
node dist/src/index.js start-run \
  --goal "Add verification-loop scaffolding to Laizy" \
  --plan examples/demo-implementation-plan.md \
  --out state/runs/example-run.json
```

Artifacts created:

- `state/runs/example-run.json` — derived snapshot
- `state/runs/example-run.events.jsonl` — append-only event log
- `state/runs/example-run.bootstrap/` — initial supervisor/bootstrap bundle

## 2. Supervisor selects the next bounded action

```bash
node dist/src/index.js supervisor-tick \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --out-dir state/runs/example-run.supervisor
```

The supervisor bundle is the durable handoff point. Read these files first:

- `state/runs/example-run.supervisor/supervisor-manifest.json` — index of what was emitted
- `state/runs/example-run.supervisor/supervisor-decision.json` — bounded decision, reason, and continuation summary
- `state/runs/example-run.supervisor/E1.implementer-contract.json` — repo-native implementation contract when the decision is `continue`

The decision now includes event-derived state so restart/resume is easier to audit from artifacts alone:

- `eventDerivedState.eventCount` and `eventDerivedState.lastEventAt` tell you whether the bundle was emitted from a fresh run or a rebuilt/resumed one
- `eventDerivedState.activeMilestone` captures the current milestone status, last update time, and last note
- `continuation.mode` explains whether the operator should start, continue, resume-after-rebuild, verify, recover, or close out
- `continuation.recommendedDocumentKind` points to the next durable document to open instead of relying on chat memory
- the emitted contract remains bounded to one milestone, so restart/resume does not silently broaden the work slice

## 3. Implementer receives the bounded milestone

When `supervisor-decision.json` says `decision: "continue"`, use the emitted contract from the supervisor bundle instead of regenerating one by hand:

- `state/runs/example-run.supervisor/E1.implementer-contract.json`
- `state/runs/example-run.supervisor/E1.implementer-spawn.json`

The OpenClaw adapter is transport-specific, but the implementer contract remains repo-native and durable.

## 4. Implementer marks progress

```bash
node dist/src/index.js transition \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --milestone E2 \
  --status implementing \
  --note "implementer started bounded worker-contract wiring"

node dist/src/index.js heartbeat \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --worker laizy-implementer \
  --note "implementer contract and bundle docs in progress"
```

## 5. Watchdog inspects health on cadence

```bash
node dist/src/index.js emit-openclaw-cron \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --out state/adapters/example-watchdog-cron.json

node dist/src/index.js inspect-health \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --stall-threshold-minutes 15 \
  --out state/reports/example-health.json
```

If the run is stalled, the watchdog should create a bounded recovery plan instead of improvising.

## 6. Recovery resumes safely when needed

```bash
node dist/src/index.js plan-recovery \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --stall-threshold-minutes 15 \
  --out state/reports/example-recovery.json

node dist/src/index.js snapshot \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json

node dist/src/index.js supervisor-tick \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --out-dir state/runs/example-run.supervisor-resume
```

Recovery should either restart, re-handoff, or escalate the current milestone. It should not widen scope.

That restart-safe path is intentionally artifact-first: rebuild from the event log, inspect the new supervisor bundle, then reopen the recommended durable document instead of relying on prior chat context.

The `snapshot` rebuild step is the restart-safe handoff point. After rebuilding from `example-run.events.jsonl`, run `supervisor-tick` again and inspect the new bundle:

- if `continuation.mode` is `resume-after-rebuild`, reopen the emitted implementer contract and continue the same milestone
- if `continuation.mode` is `recover-before-continuing`, use the emitted recovery plan before handing work back to the implementer
- the event-derived state in the supervisor decision lets you confirm the resumed bundle still points at the same milestone and latest verification/recovery context

## 7. Verification and reviewer loop

```bash
node dist/src/index.js transition \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --milestone E2 \
  --status verifying \
  --note "implementation complete; running build-check"

node dist/src/index.js emit-verification-command \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --milestone E2 \
  --command "/usr/bin/node scripts/build-check.mjs" \
  --out state/verification/example-command.json

/usr/bin/node scripts/build-check.mjs

node dist/src/index.js emit-reviewer-output \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --milestone E2 \
  --verdict approved \
  --summary "build-check passed" \
  --next-action complete-milestone \
  --out state/verification/example-review.json

node dist/src/index.js record-verification-result \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --milestone E2 \
  --command "/usr/bin/node scripts/build-check.mjs" \
  --status passed \
  --reviewer-output state/verification/example-review.json \
  --summary "build-check passed"
```

Only after the passed verification result is recorded should the milestone move to `completed`.

If verification fails, keep the retry bounded to the same milestone and let the durable artifacts explain the redo path:

```bash
node dist/src/index.js record-verification-result \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --milestone E2 \
  --command "/usr/bin/node scripts/build-check.mjs" \
  --status failed \
  --reviewer-output state/verification/example-review.json \
  --summary "build-check failed; address findings and retry E2"

node dist/src/index.js transition \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --milestone E2 \
  --status implementing \
  --note "retrying E2 after failed verification"

node dist/src/index.js supervisor-tick \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --out-dir state/runs/example-run.supervisor-retry
```

After that retry-oriented supervisor tick, inspect the new bundle and confirm it is still scoped to `E2`:

- `supervisor-decision.json` should keep `activeMilestoneId: "E2"`
- `eventDerivedState.latestVerification.status` should show `failed`
- `eventDerivedState.latestVerification.evidence.reviewerNextAction` explains the reviewer-directed redo step when present
- `decision.reason`, `continuation.summary`, and the implementer action summary should explicitly say the next move is a bounded retry on the active milestone rather than a broader recovery or a new milestone
- `E2.implementer-contract.json` remains the durable handoff document for the redo path, so the retry stays compatibility-safe and single-milestone scoped
- the snapshot verification history should make it obvious that `completed` is still blocked until a later passed verification result is recorded for `E2`

The repository build-check reinforces this example by asserting the docs and runtime flows keep describing the same restart-safe supervisor/recovery behavior, bounded retry semantics, and verification-gated completion evidence.

## 8. Milestone closeout

```bash
node dist/src/index.js transition \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --milestone E2 \
  --status completed \
  --note "verification passed"
```

## Operator expectations

- Work one highest-priority incomplete milestone at a time.
- Use the supervised path: `start-run` once, then `supervisor-tick` for continuation.
- Verify every milestone before completion.
- Commit exactly once per landed milestone.
- Push immediately after every milestone commit.
- Keep the watchdog cadence active while unchecked milestones remain.
- Disable the watchdog only after the plan is fully complete and the final verification checkpoint passes.
