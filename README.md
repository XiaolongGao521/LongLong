# Laizy

Laizy is a repo-native control loop for coding-agent work.

It does not try to replace Codex, Claude Code, OpenClaw, or other coding agents. It wraps them in a durable, milestone-based delivery loop so the next step is explicit, verification is recorded, and interrupted work can resume from repo state instead of chat memory.

## What it does

Laizy helps an operator run work through a narrow sequence:

1. start from a local implementation plan
2. bootstrap a run
3. ask the supervisor what should happen next
4. execute one bounded milestone action
5. record verification before completion
6. recover or resume safely when the loop stalls

The point is not more autonomy theatre. The point is a cleaner control surface for repo work that already uses coding agents.

## Core ideas

- **Repo-local plan** — the active queue lives in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` or another local milestone plan file.
- **Durable run state** — the run snapshot and event log live under `state/runs/`.
- **Bounded worker contracts** — planner, implementer, recovery, verifier, and watchdog handoffs are emitted as explicit documents.
- **Verification gate** — a milestone is not complete until a passed verification result is recorded.
- **Recovery path** — stalls and interruptions are part of the model, not exceptional cases hidden in chat.

## Recommended operator flow

Bootstrap once:

```bash
laizy start-run \
  --goal "Turn a brief into a verified PR" \
  --plan IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md \
  --out state/runs/my-run.json
```

Continue from durable state:

```bash
laizy supervisor-tick \
  --snapshot state/runs/my-run.json \
  --out-dir state/runs/my-run.supervisor
```

Consume the emitted supervisor bundle instead of improvising the next step in chat.

## What gets written

A typical run produces:

- `state/runs/<run>.json` — derived run snapshot
- `state/runs/<run>.events.jsonl` — append-only event log
- `state/runs/<run>.bootstrap/` — initial bundle from `start-run`
- `state/runs/<run>.supervisor/` — next-action bundle from `supervisor-tick`
- `state/verification/` — reviewer and verification artifacts when used

These files make it possible to inspect, pause, resume, and recover the loop without reconstructing state from memory.

## Supervisor decisions

`supervisor-tick` evaluates the current snapshot and emits one bounded decision:

- `plan` — the run needs an actionable plan
- `continue` — start or continue the active milestone
- `recover` — resume safely from a stall or blocked path
- `verify` — run the required acceptance check
- `closeout` — disable watchdogs and end the run

The next action is described by machine-readable artifacts in the supervisor bundle.

## Worker roles

Laizy keeps worker responsibilities explicit:

- **planner** — creates or repairs the milestone plan
- **implementer** — executes one milestone at a time
- **watchdog** — checks progress on cadence
- **recovery** — repairs and resumes the conveyor without widening scope
- **verifier** — records the evidence needed to complete a milestone

## Backends and runtimes

Laizy keeps its core loop separate from execution backends.

Today the repo can emit adapter documents for:

- OpenClaw session spawn/send/history/cron flows
- Codex CLI execution
- Claude Code execution
- local `laizy watchdog` cadence

Across all of those adapters, the operator guidance should stay the same:

- **Laizy remains the control plane** — run `start-run` once, then use `supervisor-tick` to emit the next bounded action from durable repo state.
- **OpenClaw is the session runtime** — prefer `runtime=subagent` or another runtime-backed session for planner, implementer, recovery, and verifier handoffs.
- **Codex CLI is a one-shot worker runtime** — use a PTY-backed `codex exec --full-auto ...` invocation for the emitted contract.
- **Claude Code is a one-shot worker runtime** — use `claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions --print ...` without PTY for the emitted contract.
- **`laizy watchdog` is the cadence runtime** — run it locally against the same snapshot/out-dir instead of inventing a chat-only watchdog loop.

Backend preflight artifacts are also emitted so worker handoff can fail early when a configured runtime is unavailable.

These adapter documents are intentionally thin and replaceable: they restate durable control-loop intent for a specific runtime without pushing backend-specific concerns into the run snapshot schema.

### Backend configuration overrides

You can override worker backends with `--backend-config` as inline JSON or as a path to a JSON file.

Example:

```json
{
  "planner": "openclaw",
  "implementer": { "backend": "codex-cli", "preferredRuntime": "pty" },
  "recovery": "claude-code",
  "verifier": "openclaw",
  "watchdog": "laizy-watchdog"
}
```

Use the operator-facing validation command before handoff when you want an explicit preflight summary:

```bash
laizy check-backends \
  --snapshot state/runs/my-run.json \
  --out-dir state/runs/my-run.backend-checks \
  --backend-config backend-config.json
```

That keeps backend issues visible before a worker is asked to act.

The intended Stage 5 operator story is deliberately simple and compatibility-safe:

1. run `laizy check-backends` when you want a concise preflight verdict before handoff
2. keep `start-run` / `supervisor-tick` as the durable repo-native control loop
3. hand the emitted contract to the selected runtime only after the backend summary says handoff is ready
4. treat backend failures as probe-backed setup work, not as a reason to rename commands or widen milestone scope

## Install

```bash
npm install -g laizy
```

Or run it from the repo after compiling:

```bash
node dist/src/index.js --help
```

### Fresh install checklist

A clean Laizy install has two parts:

1. install the CLIs you plan to use
2. make sure your operator/runtime environment can actually find and approve those binaries

Typical setup:

```bash
npm install -g laizy openclaw @openai/codex
# install Claude Code separately if you plan to use it so `claude` resolves on PATH
```

If you are running from a repo checkout instead of the published binary, prefer:

```bash
node dist/src/index.js --help
```

and treat `/usr/bin/node` as the important executable to approve/allowlist, rather than a global `laizy` shim.

Resolve the binaries you expect Laizy/OpenClaw to use:

```bash
command -v laizy || true
command -v openclaw || true
command -v codex || true
command -v claude || true
command -v node
command -v git
command -v bash || command -v sh
```

If OpenClaw exec runs with a minimal PATH on your gateway/node host, add the directory that contains those CLIs to `tools.exec.pathPrepend`.
Typical examples are `~/.nvm/versions/node/<version>/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, or `/usr/local/bin`.

### OpenClaw allowlist baseline for Laizy

If you drive Laizy through OpenClaw with `tools.exec.security=allowlist`, allowlist the **resolved executable paths** you actually need.

For a typical Laizy loop, that usually means:

- `laizy` **or** `/usr/bin/node` (depending on whether you run the published binary or `node dist/src/index.js`)
- `openclaw`
- `codex` if you use the Codex CLI backend
- `claude` if you use the Claude Code backend
- `/usr/bin/node` for verification commands such as `/usr/bin/node scripts/build-check.mjs`
- `/usr/bin/git` for commit/push steps
- `/usr/bin/env` plus your shell (`/bin/bash`, `/usr/bin/bash`, or `/bin/sh`) if you want `laizy check-backends` to run its shell-based installation probes through OpenClaw exec

Example allowlist commands:

```bash
openclaw approvals allowlist add --agent main "~/.nvm/versions/node/*/bin/laizy"
openclaw approvals allowlist add --agent main "~/.nvm/versions/node/*/bin/openclaw"
openclaw approvals allowlist add --agent main "~/.nvm/versions/node/*/bin/codex"
openclaw approvals allowlist add --agent main "/usr/bin/node"
openclaw approvals allowlist add --agent main "/usr/bin/git"
openclaw approvals allowlist add --agent main "/usr/bin/env"
openclaw approvals allowlist add --agent main "/bin/bash"
# if Claude Code lives elsewhere, resolve it first and allowlist the exact path
CLAUDE_BIN="$(command -v claude)"
openclaw approvals allowlist add --agent main "$CLAUDE_BIN"
```

Important: do **not** put `node`, `bash`, `sh`, `openclaw`, `laizy`, `codex`, or `claude` in `tools.exec.safeBins`.
`safeBins` is only for narrow stdin-only filters such as `jq`, `head`, `tail`, and `wc`.
Runtime binaries belong in the explicit allowlist (`openclaw approvals allowlist ...` / `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`).

### Fresh install smoke check

Once the binaries are installed and approved, do a quick end-to-end smoke check:

```bash
laizy start-run \
  --goal "Smoke-test Laizy install" \
  --plan examples/demo-implementation-plan.md \
  --out state/runs/install-smoke.json

laizy check-backends \
  --snapshot state/runs/install-smoke.json \
  --out-dir state/runs/install-smoke.backend-checks

/usr/bin/node scripts/build-check.mjs
```

If you are running from the repo checkout rather than a published install, replace `laizy` with `node dist/src/index.js` in the examples above.

## CLI surface

The published package exposes one binary:

```bash
laizy
```

Useful commands:

- `laizy start-run` — bootstrap a run and emit the initial bundle
- `laizy supervisor-tick` — evaluate durable state and emit the next bounded action
- `laizy watchdog` — run local watchdog cadence
- `laizy check-backends` — inspect backend readiness for configured worker roles
- `laizy transition` — record milestone lifecycle changes
- `laizy record-verification-result` — persist verification evidence

## Runtime examples

OpenClaw handoff example:

```json
{
  "adapter": "sessions_spawn",
  "runtime": "subagent",
  "operatorGuidance": {
    "loopSummary": "Keep Laizy as the control plane: start-run once, then supervisor-tick to emit the next bounded action from durable repo state."
  }
}
```

Codex CLI handoff example:

```bash
codex exec --full-auto "<contract emitted by Laizy>"
```

Claude Code handoff example:

```bash
claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions --print "<contract emitted by Laizy>"
```

Local watchdog example:

```bash
laizy watchdog \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --out-dir state/runs/example-run.supervisor \
  --interval-seconds 300 \
  --stall-threshold-minutes 15 \
  --verification-command "/usr/bin/node scripts/build-check.mjs"
```

## Example lifecycle

### 1. Start the run

```bash
laizy start-run \
  --goal "Add verification-loop scaffolding" \
  --plan examples/demo-implementation-plan.md \
  --out state/runs/example-run.json
```

### 2. Ask the supervisor for the next action

```bash
laizy supervisor-tick \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --out-dir state/runs/example-run.supervisor
```

### 3. Execute the bounded action

If the decision is `continue`, read the emitted implementer contract and perform exactly that milestone.

### 4. Verify before completion

For example:

```bash
/usr/bin/node scripts/build-check.mjs

laizy record-verification-result \
  --snapshot state/runs/example-run.json \
  --milestone L7 \
  --command "/usr/bin/node scripts/build-check.mjs" \
  --status passed \
  --summary "build-check passed"
```

### 5. Close out or continue

Run `supervisor-tick` again. The next bundle will tell you whether to continue, recover, verify, or close out.

## OpenClaw skill

This repo also ships an OpenClaw/AgentSkills-compatible skill source at:

```text
skills/laizy/
```

That skill teaches OpenClaw how to drive the `start-run` / `supervisor-tick` flow around existing coding agents.

## Development

Run the repo verification/build check:

```bash
/usr/bin/node scripts/build-check.mjs
```

Common repo scripts:

```bash
npm run build
npm run ralph:plan
npm run ralph:build
```

## Product boundary

Laizy is intentionally narrow.

It is not trying to be:

- a hosted control plane
- a replacement for your coding agent
- a generic workflow system for every domain
- an excuse to hide state in prompts

It is a durable repo control loop for milestone-based coding work.
