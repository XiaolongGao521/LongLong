# IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

Goal: turn Laizy into a reusable, repo-native autonomous software delivery engine based on the exact Ralph-loop process already used in SillyAvatar.

## Execution rules
- The plan is the authoritative execution queue for Ralph-style work in this repository.
- Build mode should advance one highest-priority incomplete milestone at a time.
- Every completed milestone must be verified, committed once, and pushed.
- Watchdog and recovery behavior should stay aligned with `AGENTS.md`.

### [x] L1 - Bootstrap the repo-local Ralph contract and initial run-state CLI
- Added repository workflow files mirroring the SillyAvatar Ralph process.
- Added an architecture document clarifying the generalized Laizy model.
- Added a runnable CLI slice for parsing the plan, reporting the next milestone, and initializing run state.
- Verification checkpoint: `npm run build`
- Discovery: a zero-dependency Node ESM bootstrap keeps the first slice deterministic while the orchestration model is still settling.
- Discovery: encoding milestone parsing early gives later workers a stable, machine-readable contract to follow.

### [x] L2 - Add persistent event-log-backed run state
- Introduced append-only run events and derived run snapshots.
- Added milestone lifecycle transitions (`planned`, `implementing`, `verifying`, `completed`, `blocked`).
- Kept the storage format simple JSONL + derived snapshot JSON.
- Verification checkpoint: `npm run build`
- Discovery: storing the full initialized run payload inside the first event makes snapshot rebuilds deterministic without needing a second source of truth.
- Discovery: keeping snapshots derived and disposable makes watchdog/recovery logic easier to reason about than mutating primary state in place.

### [x] L3 - Add planner / implementer command contracts
- Model worker intents and handoff envelopes as durable JSON documents.
- Add commands to select the next actionable milestone and emit implementer instructions.
- Preserve strict single-milestone scope in the emitted work contract.
- Verification checkpoint: `npm run build`
- Discovery: carrying milestone bullet details into run snapshots keeps worker contracts specific without forcing later workers to re-parse the markdown plan.
- Discovery: emitting planner intent separately from the implementer contract creates a stable handoff seam for future watchdog and recovery workers.

### [x] L4 - Add watchdog inspection and stall detection
- Add heartbeat metadata and run-health evaluation.
- Detect idle/stalled implementer states deterministically.
- Emit machine-readable recovery recommendations instead of freeform text.
- Verification checkpoint: `npm run build`
- Discovery: heartbeat events work best as append-only log entries that project into snapshot state, because watchdog inspection can then be fully deterministic from durable artifacts.
- Discovery: separating `run.health` from `recovery.recommendation` keeps health inspection readable while preserving a strict machine-actionable output for future recovery workers.

### [x] L5 - Add recovery planning and resume logic
- Convert watchdog findings into bounded recovery actions.
- Support restart, re-handoff, and blocked-state escalation paths.
- Record every recovery action in the run event log.
- Verification checkpoint: `npm run build`
- Discovery: recovery plans become much easier to consume when they embed an optional resume contract instead of forcing the recovery worker to recompute implementer scope.
- Discovery: persisting recovery actions directly into snapshot state gives watchdogs a durable audit trail and prevents repeated blind restarts.

### [x] L6 - Add OpenClaw orchestration adapters
- Added adapter documents for `sessions_spawn`, `sessions_send`, `sessions_history`, and `cron`.
- Kept OpenClaw transport/runtime details out of the core run-state model by emitting machine-readable adapter envelopes.
- Preserved the stable worker labels defined in `AGENTS.md` across all emitted adapter payloads.
- Verification checkpoint: `/usr/bin/node scripts/build-check.mjs`
- Discovery: emitting transport requests as standalone adapter documents keeps the durable run snapshot portable while still giving supervisors deterministic OpenClaw instructions.
- Discovery: stable worker-label resolution belongs in one adapter layer so future runtimes can reuse the same orchestration contract without touching core milestone state.

### [x] L7 - Add verification and reviewer loop scaffolding
- Modeled verification commands and persisted verification results as first-class artifacts.
- Added reviewer/evaluator output contracts for post-implementation checks.
- Gated milestone completion on explicit passed verification status.
- Verification checkpoint: `/usr/bin/node scripts/build-check.mjs`
- Discovery: verification needs its own durable event stream so watchdog and recovery workers can distinguish “not yet verified” from “verified and failed” without scraping logs.
- Discovery: milestone-completion gating must validate before appending the transition event, otherwise failed completion attempts pollute the run log.

### [x] L8 - Add end-to-end example run docs
- Documented a sample brief-to-run flow using the Laizy CLI artifacts.
- Showed how the planner, implementer, watchdog, recovery, and verifier workers interact.
- Captured operator expectations for commit/push/closeout behavior.
- Verification checkpoint: `/usr/bin/node scripts/build-check.mjs`
- Discovery: a concrete operator walkthrough exposes contract gaps faster than API-only docs because milestone handoffs become testable end-to-end.
- Discovery: verification tooling should avoid assuming a fixed next milestone so the same smoke check keeps working as the plan advances.
